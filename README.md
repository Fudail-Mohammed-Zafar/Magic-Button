# Magic Motion Button

A visually engaging button with interactive 3D elements that animate when hovered. This project uses HTML, CSS, and images to create a magic button effect where shapes like a cone, torus, icosahedron, and sphere move dynamically around the button.

## Features

- **Magic Button Animation:** Hovering over the button triggers an interactive animation with 3D geometric shapes.
- **Dynamic Effects:** The button expands, and the shapes animate around the button.
- **CSS-only Animations:** The entire effect is created using only HTML and CSS, with no JavaScript required.
